# Goal
The command line is often intimidating to many people. Our objective was to create a game to help people learn how to use the command line. In our game, you play as Angel, wandering the deep dungeons of the dark web, where evil malware can be encountered. The battle system would be a command line interface, in which scripts are run to attack the enemy.

## Challenges
We had to learn how to use Godot, an open source game engine. Still by the end of the day, were able to create a simple 2d dungeon crawler with collisions and walls.
